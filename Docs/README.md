# Alter Ego Docs

Welcome to the Alter Ego Docs! This documentation website serves as a knowledge hub for Alter Ego, a Discord bot
used to facilitate an
in-depth, multiplayer text adventure role-playing game, called the Neo World Program. It is an ongoing project
maintained by Alter Ego's developer, MolSno. While development of Alter Ego has slowed significantly since its creation
in 2019, this Wiki is kept up-to-date with the most recent changes.

Alter Ego is an open-source project that anyone can fork and modify to suit their own purposes. This Wiki aims to
provide accurate, useful documentation and explanations for both casual users and developers.
