# Eligible commands

Eligible commands are usable by users with the [[Eligible role|Tutorial:-Installation-and-setup#eligible]] (or
the [[Tester role|Tutorial:-Installation-and-setup#tester]] if Alter Ego is in [[debug mode]]). These commands have
extremely limited use, only usable by Players before they've been given the Player role.

Eligible commands can only be used when a game is in progress. They can only be sent in
the [[general channel|Tutorial:-Installation-and-setup#channel-general]] (or
the [[testing channel|Tutorial:-Installation-and-setup#channel-testing]] if debug mode is on). If Alter Ego accepts the
user's command, the message in which the command was issued will be deleted.

Below is a list of all eligible commands, as well as information about each one.
