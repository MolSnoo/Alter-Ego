I suspect that if you are watching this, then at least two people have died. Perhaps there have been more. That is good. The game is proceeding smoothly.<br /><br />First, allow me to make something very clear. This is a recording made before the game began. I cannot answer any of your questions directly. With that out of the way, allow me to introduce myself. As you may have already guessed, I am the mastermind. I am the one who created this game for you all to participate in. However, to say I did so singlehandedly would be incorrect. This killing game simply would not be possible without the assistance of others. Though the ones directly responsible for it are few, it could be said that the game's indirect contributors are many. That sounds strange, does it not? I assure you, in due time everything will make sense, though many more of you will have perished by then. That much is certain.</s></desc>","<desc><s>Now then, I have two reasons for creating this recording. First, I would like to ask you a question. How can you know that anything is real? It may seem like a question with an obvious answer: 'I can see it, I can touch it, etc.' That is a sufficient answer for most people. However, to rely on your senses would be a mistake. When you look at something, light reflected off of that object enters your eye, where it is absorbed by your retina. The light that enters your eye is upside down and backwards. To correct this, your brain flips the image so that objects up, down, left, and right of you appear in those positions in your field of vision. Likewise, when you touch something, special sensory receptors in your skin send an electrical signal to your nervous system, which ultimately ends up in your brain. The brain is where the texture of the object you touched is processed into information you can understand. 'This desk is hard. This pillow is soft. Snow is cold. The oven is hot.' These sensations would not be understood without your brain.<br /><br />Do you understand? All information about the outside world, no matter how it is sensed, is processed in the brain. Even your physical body constitutes part of the outside world. If all information is processed in your brain, then can you truly be certain that anything outside of your own thoughts is real? All the symphonies of Mozart, all the works of Shakespeare, all science and mathematics could very well be naught but fabrications created by your brain. This idea is called solipsism, and it cannot be proven false. Any reasonable person would want to deny it. The idea that all your loved ones and everything you have ever cared about may not really exist is nigh impossible to grapple with. What is one to do when confronted with this idea? Let me ask: why are people religious? There is no concrete evidence that God or a higher power exists. Ultimately, only when one chooses to believe that something is real can it become real.</s></desc>"],["CONFERENCE VIDEO PART 2","FALSE","30s","","","conference-room","","","","<desc><s>Allow me to move on to my second reason for creating this recording. This information will perhaps be more immediately useful to you. Some of you may have guessed this already, but this is not the first killing game of its kind. Nor is it the second. This is actually the 56th entry in a series known as Danganronpa. Though the first 49 entries in the series consisted of video games and anime, Danganronpa 50 was the first to use real participants. I hesitate to call them 'real' for a variety of reasons which I will not explain here, however it is true that living humans were used from that point on. The franchise was produced by Team Danganronpa, which dissolved after the 53rd entry. For a time, it seemed as if the Danganronpa franchise was over. However, **a certain person** succeeded in bringing it back, this time using actual students of Hope's Peak Academy. This was the first entry in a new series of Danganronpa: Neo Danganronpa 54. This is the third entry in that series: Neo Danganronpa 56. You should consider yourselves lucky to be participating in such a beloved game.<br /><br />That is all the information I have for you at this time. You surely have many more questions, but I cannot answer them. As I said, all will make sense in due time. Who will be left to learn the truth, however, remains to be seen. Now then, I bid you adieu.
