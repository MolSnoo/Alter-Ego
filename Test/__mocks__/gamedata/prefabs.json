She has revealed the creation of a fully-functioning android with an AI that is so lifelike it is able to blend in perfectly with society. You may wonder, how does she know it’s flawless?<br /><br />As it turns out, her own daughter, Natalie Spark, originally known as the Ultimate DJ, is that exact android. She’s been living under our noses for years now, along with her family, who have known all along.<br /><br />Her other “parent”, Ashley Spark, is a renowned programmer who created her own programming language, which Takayoshi claims was used to create this Ultimate Android. That, along with Takayoshi’s invention of a biomass reactor that converts organic waste into energy, is what allowed this artificial intelligence to perform in this manner.<br /><br />Multiple reporters have asked Takayoshi what else she has been hiding from the world, but she has declined to comment.```</s></desc>"],["FURBALL","STUFFED CAT","a STUFFED
